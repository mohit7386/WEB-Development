        <h3>Let's go through each type of CSS positioning and its common uses:</h3><br>

        <li>Static Positioning:</li><br>

        <p>This is the default positioning for all HTML elements.
            Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
            You typically don't need to explicitly set position: static;, as it's the default behavior.</p><br>
        <li>Relative Positioning:</li><br>

        <p>Elements are positioned relative to their normal position in the document flow.
            When you apply position: relative; to an element, you can use top, right, bottom, and left properties to
            offset
            it from its normal position.
            Commonly used for fine-tuning the position of elements within their containing block or to create simple
            animations.</p><br>
        <li>Absolute Positioning:</li><br>

        <p>Elements are removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to their nearest positioned
            ancestor.
            If no positioned ancestor is found, they're positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the
            viewport).
            Useful for creating overlays, pop-up modals, or elements that need to be precisely positioned within their
            parent container.</p><br>
        <li>Fixed Positioning:</li><br>

        <p>Elements are positioned relative to the viewport and do not move when the page is scrolled.
            Commonly used for creating elements that should remain in a fixed position on the screen, such as navigation
            bars or headers.</p><br>
        <li>Sticky Positioning:</li><br>

        <p>Elements behave like relative positioning until they reach a specified threshold, then they become fixed
            positioning.
            When you apply position: sticky;, you typically also specify top, right, bottom, or left properties to
            determine
            the threshold where the element becomes fixed.
            Useful for creating elements that should stick to a specific position on the screen as the user scrolls,
            such as
            sticky headers or sidebars.
            Each type of positioning has its own use cases, and understanding when to use each one can help you create
            more
            effective and dynamic layouts for your web pages.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="lucky">Note:- transform , filter and perspective property can also the element appear as positioned. when you apply the property in any of these then you will see it will look like position:relative there is no change so that's why these three properties also appear as positioned.</p>
